Ive been playing with this code for tensorflow.

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/models/image/imagenet/classify_image.py

It downloads an image inception pre-trained model.(inception)   then it downloads an image of a Panda and classifies it (cropped_panda.jpg).  It places the data in the folder tmp/imagenet from root.

You can download random images and see how well it classifies them.  It gives each classifier a number between zero and 1.0.  It does not care about dimensions.  I tested it with cards it has no pre-trained data for playing cards.  I tested it on other animals it seems to work well.

In order to install tensorflow you will need to have at least ubuntu 14.  Then use the PIP installation described in the following link.(the other ones do not work)
